description: "Ask UFC flyweight champion Demetrious Johnson whether he's cleaned out his division, and he'll tell you that, technically, he's got more opponents to fight. There's fighters such as Jussier Formiga, Zach Makovsky, Wilson Reis, and his upcoming challenge, Olympic gold medalist Henry Cejudo (9-0 MMA, 3-0 UFC), whom he's scheduled to fight April 23 at UFC 197."
